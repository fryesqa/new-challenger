## Usage

After downloading or cloning, run npm install. There is a post-install npm script that will build and compile the client files using webpack. 

Use psql (postgreSQL) for database, whether local or remote. Make sure to create the database and pass in user/pw, and connect to the database source as an environment variable. 

Be sure to get Facebook Client Key & Secret for authorization.

For starting the app, run node server/server.js or deploy remotely.
